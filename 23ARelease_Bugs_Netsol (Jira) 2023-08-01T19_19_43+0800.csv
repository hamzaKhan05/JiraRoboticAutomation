We have observed that body funding details including the fund indicator are passed correctly in GetFinancialChartData from DTP side.

 

However the finance amount returned to DTP does not seem to be correct, which is causing the miscalculation of downpayment in DTP.

 

This issue needs to be checked by NETSOL team.  required details attached - INC3462239_BodyFunding_UAT_Analysis.docx;;;","30/Jun/23 1:46 PM;NKAKARL;[~NETSMTH]

As per team, issue is fixed related to retail application. Team has communicated it in attached email. Now, issue exists at DTP FE side. Please check it internally and also share detailed information e.g. DTP logs of these impacted applications for our team analysis.

As per our combined GTM analysis it is observed that calculation logic is fixed at CMS side which resulted DTP values of down payment & finance amounts are correctly computed in DTP FE, However the body funding & insurance amounts which captured in DTP FE are not flowing to CMS as there is a breakage where data is not being saved properly at DTP side resulted body funding values showing NULL in CMS after application submitted from DTP.

 

We have concluded that this is a DTP issue and DTP team is further looking into this issue.
